# Professional Self-Assessment
* * *
My name is Ryan Miller. I started my Computer Science journey at Navarro College in Corsicana Texas in 2020. I received my A.S. in Computer Science from Navarro College in the fall of 2021. I then began working on my B.S. in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University in the fall 2022. I have a great deal of appreciation for both of the institutions I attended. Learning through two different approaches to computer science education has made me a more versatile engineer as I have my education has been equal parts practical and theory. Along the way, I have gained new skills and improved upon old ones. I have become increasingly detail oriented and mindful of best practices in my work. I have become proficient in multiple languages, including Java, C++, and Python. I have gained skills in database management and project planning. I am appropriately cautious in my approach to development, testing as I go, and I have become quite skilled at tracking down issues and bugs in my own code and in the work of others. I try to apply professional security standards in my work where possible, this makes up a big part of best practice to me and I try to implement security solutions in my work wherever I see a need. I do my best to keep all of my work well commented, organized, and easy to follow. I enjoy taking part in peer review processes, having my code reviewed and reviewing the code of others. 

During my time at SNHU, I took a course that focused on the importance of version control in project development. It involved a class wide group project where every student was responsible for adding a given feature one piece at a time on their own branch, and continually remerging back into the main branch with the rest of the class. This required class wide code reviews. This experience was very valuable because it was one of the first times I had the opportunity to work on a project with such a large group of people while also having the ability to make suggestions, approve or deny pull requests. I was able to really dig into other developers’ code, analyze conflicts, and do my part to ensure everything continued to go smoothly. 

As an engineer, I place great value in clarity. It is very important to me that I fully understand the needs and requirements of a project. I try not to make assumptions and I will always reach out first if a conflict or issue arises in order to ensure that the client/stakeholders are getting the solution they need. I received frequent praise for this value when I was studying at Navarro College. There were multiple instances in which project requirements were unclear and only a few of us chose to reach out to a professor or other “stakeholder” in the project for clarity. Usually this resulted in a program that actually solved the problem, while much of the rest of the class had made assumptions that had either limited the functionality of their solution or fell short of the project requirements. 

To help showcase my skills and everything I have learned over the last four years, I have selected three artifacts from my time at SNHU. These are all final projects from courses I completed, and the enhancements I have made to them will highlight my competence across the following outcomes:

*   Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
*   
*   Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
*   
*   Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
*   
*   Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
*   
*   Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

I have taken many classes throughout my time in this program, but the courses I selected artifacts from where all courses in which I either learned something very new and challenging, or cases in which I felt I could have taken my work much further but didn’t for lack of time or scope. These artifacts include a C++ program that was translated to Java and then reformatted as a GUI, an OpenGL program in which I wrote and implemented an algorithm to dynamically generate and texture cylinders, and an Android mobile application for inventory management in which I refactored the existing database solution to tie entries to user accounts and provide support of sorting and searching functions on the database screen. These artifacts provide weight to this portfolio by clearly presenting my aforementioned skills in one place, without the need to download, examine, and run these applications yourself (though you can).
